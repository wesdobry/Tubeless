## ffmpeg: build configuration and corresponding source

The published images ship a **GPL build** of ffmpeg — it is configured with `--enable-gpl --enable-version3`, so the resulting binaries are covered by **GPL-3.0-or-later**, not LGPL. Distributing the Tubeless container image therefore conveys GPL binaries, and the corresponding source must be made available; it is linked below.

The binary is not built by this project. It is a prebuilt artifact downloaded in `docker/ci-base.Dockerfile` from [yt-dlp/FFmpeg-Builds](https://github.com/yt-dlp/FFmpeg-Builds) and copied into the release image by `docker/selfhosted.Dockerfile`.
