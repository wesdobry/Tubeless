# Run the equivalent of .github/workflows/ci.yml's `test` job locally, before
# pushing. It executes the exact same steps inside the exact same configured
# ci-base image CI uses, so a green run here means a green `test` job in CI.
#
# Why Docker: the repo has no committed SQLean extensions and assumes a Linux
# toolchain (yt-dlp/ffmpeg/Deno/Apprise + Elixir/OTP/Node) that the ci-base
# image bakes in. Running natively on macOS would drift from CI.
#
# Isolation: your host is likely macOS, so we must NOT let the Linux container
# compile into your host deps/_build (arch mismatch). Those dirs — plus the two
# node_modules — live in named Docker volumes, mirroring docker-compose.ci.yml.
# They persist between runs (fast incremental re-runs) and never touch your host
# tree. Pass --clean to wipe them and start fresh.
#
# Prerequisite: Docker running. The CI base image is public on Docker Hub. Usage:
#   tooling/lint_test.sh            # full run (deps + sqlean + db + mix check)
#   tooling/lint_test.sh --clean    # drop cached volumes first, then full run
#   tooling/lint_test.sh --shell    # drop into a shell in the CI container
