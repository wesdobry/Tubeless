## Important

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Tubeless is a rebranded, actively-developed successor to [Pinchflat](https://github.com/kieraneglin/pinchflat). It supports drop-in migration from Pinchflat — both the original `kieraneglin/pinchflat` and the `CommunityMaintained/pinchflat` fork — and from here focuses on shipping new features and usability improvements rather than tracking upstream.
>
> Migration is one-way: there is no supported path back to Pinchflat. See [Migrating from Pinchflat](https://github.com/CommunityMaintained/tubeless/wiki/Migrating-from-Pinchflat). PRs welcome — see [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md).

## What it does

Tubeless is a self-hosted app for downloading YouTube content built using [yt-dlp](https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp). It's designed to be lightweight, self-contained, and easy to use. You set up rules for how to download content from YouTube channels or playlists, and it'll do the rest, periodically checking for new content. It's perfect for people who want to download content for use with a media center app (Plex, Jellyfin, Kodi) or for those who want to archive media!

While you can [download individual videos](https://github.com/CommunityMaintained/tubeless/wiki/Frequently-Asked-Questions#how-do-i-download-one-off-videos), Tubeless is best suited for downloading content from channels or playlists. It's also not meant for consuming content in-app - Tubeless downloads content to disk where you can then watch it with a media center app or VLC.

If it doesn't work for your use case, please make a feature request! You can also check out these great alternatives: [Tube Archivist](https://github.com/tubearchivist/tubearchivist), [ytdl-sub](https://github.com/jmbannon/ytdl-sub), and [TubeSync](https://github.com/meeb/tubesync)

## Installation and configuration

#### Docker Compose (recommended):

```yaml
services:
  tubeless:
    image: wesdobry/tubeless:latest
    environment:
      # Set the timezone to your local timezone
      - TZ=America/Chicago
    ports:
      - '8945:8945'
    volumes:
      # Replace /host/path/to/config and /host/path/to/downloads
      # below with the paths of your choosing
      - /host/path/to/config:/config
      - /host/path/to/downloads:/downloads
```

[See the wiki for other install methods, full instructions, & advanced installation](https://github.com/CommunityMaintained/tubeless/wiki/Installation)

## Migrating from Pinchflat

Tubeless is a drop-in replacement for Pinchflat — the data format is identical, so no database changes are needed. This works whether you're coming from the original `kieraneglin/pinchflat` or the `CommunityMaintained/pinchflat` fork. Just update the image reference in your Docker run command or compose file:

```text
ghcr.io/kieraneglin/pinchflat:latest          →  wesdobry/tubeless:latest
ghcr.io/communitymaintained/pinchflat:latest  →  wesdobry/tubeless:latest
```

Stop the old container, update the image reference, and recreate it. Your `/config` and `/downloads` volumes carry over unchanged.

> [!WARNING]
> Migration is one-way. Tubeless develops independently and won't guarantee forward-compatibility with Pinchflat, so there is no supported path back once you've migrated. Back up your `/config` directory before switching if you want a safety net.
