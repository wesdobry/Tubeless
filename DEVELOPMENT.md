# Local Development Guide

## Dev Server (Docker — recommended)

Uses the prebuilt CI base image with all tooling (Elixir, Node, yt-dlp, ffmpeg, Deno, Apprise) baked in. Source is volume-mounted so edits reflect live.

```bash
docker compose up
# App at http://localhost:4008
```

## Dev Server (Native)

Requires Elixir 1.17+, OTP 27, Node 24, Yarn, yt-dlp, ffmpeg.

```bash
mix setup              # deps + DB create/migrate/seed + assets
iex -S mix phx.server  # http://localhost:4008
```

## Tests

```bash
mix test                                      # all tests (auto creates/migrates test DB)
mix test test/path/to/file_test.exs           # single file
mix test test/path/to/file_test.exs:42        # single test by line
```

Tests mock yt-dlp/apprise via `test/scripts/yt-dlp-mocks/` — no real network calls.

**On macOS** the suite can't run natively (needs the Linux SQLean `.so` extensions
and the yt-dlp/ffmpeg/Deno/Apprise toolchain). Run tests through Docker instead —
same configured ci-base image as CI, with a shared warm build cache:

```bash
tooling/test.sh                               # whole suite (fast iteration loop)
tooling/test.sh test/path/to/file_test.exs    # single file — args pass through to `mix test`
tooling/test.sh test/path/to/file_test.exs:42 # single test by line
tooling/test.sh --failed                      # re-run only last run's failures
tooling/lint_test.sh                          # full `mix check` — the pre-commit gate
```

## Quality Checks

```bash
mix check              # full CI suite: formatter + compiler + sobelow + prettier + ex_unit
```

Individual:

```bash
mix credo              # Elixir style
mix sobelow --config   # security scan
yarn run lint:check    # Prettier (JS/CSS)
yarn run lint:fix      # Prettier auto-fix
```

## Production Docker Build

```bash
# Standard (depends on CI base image)
docker build -f docker/selfhosted.Dockerfile -t tubeless:local .

# Self-contained (no external base image dependency)
docker build -f selfhosted.og.Dockerfile -t tubeless:local .
```

`tooling/docker-build-local.sh` wraps the standard build and adds a run/shell
loop on top, for smoke-testing the actual release image without pushing a PR:

```bash
tooling/docker-build-local.sh                # build only, tag tubeless:local
tooling/docker-build-local.sh --run           # build, then follow its logs (Ctrl-C tears it down)
tooling/docker-build-local.sh --shell         # build, run detached, then attach a shell
tooling/docker-build-local.sh --no-cache      # ignore Docker layer cache
tooling/docker-build-local.sh --tag foo:bar   # build under a different tag
```

### `docker-build-local.sh` vs. `docker compose up`

They exercise different halves of the project and aren't interchangeable:

|            | `docker compose up`                                            | `tooling/docker-build-local.sh`                                                    |
| ---------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Dockerfile | `docker/dev.Dockerfile`                                        | `docker/selfhosted.Dockerfile` (the real release image, same as `docker-pr` in CI) |
| Source     | Bind-mounted (`.:/app`) — live edits, no rebuild               | Baked into the image at build time — edit, then rebuild to see changes             |
| App start  | `mix phx.server` via `docker-run.dev.sh` (compiles on the fly) | The compiled OTP release's `docker_start` entrypoint                               |
| State      | Whatever's on disk under the repo (DB, downloads live in-tree) | Persisted separately in `tmp/docker-local/{config,downloads,podcasts}`             |
| Port       | Fixed `4008`                                                   | `PORT` env, default `8945`                                                         |
| Use case   | Day-to-day feature/bugfix work with fast iteration             | Verifying the shippable image builds and boots correctly before/instead of a PR    |

Rule of thumb: use `docker compose up` while writing code; reach for
`tooling/docker-build-local.sh --run` (or `--shell` to poke around inside) when
you want to confirm the actual production image works — e.g. after touching
the Dockerfile, release config, or anything only the compiled release path
exercises.

## Offline Database Maintenance Mode

For the times you need to work on the SQLite file itself — take a backup, copy it
somewhere, check it for corruption, hand-edit a row, or swap in a restored copy —
Tubeless can boot into a mode where **the application never starts at all**.

Set `MAINTENANCE_MODE` on the container and restart it:

```bash
docker run -e MAINTENANCE_MODE=true ...   # or add it to your compose/k8s env
```

`docker_start` checks it before anything else, so in this mode there are **no
migrations, no Oban, no Phoenix, and no Repo** — the BEAM is never started and
nothing has the database open. Accepted values are `1`, `true`, `yes`, `on`
(case-insensitive); anything else boots normally.

The container stays up so you can exec into it, and a tiny Python listener holds
the port open in the app's place — it answers **200 on every path** (JSON on
`/healthcheck`) so the Docker `HEALTHCHECK` and Kubernetes liveness/readiness
probes keep passing while you work. It never touches the database. Anyone who
loads the UI gets a plain "database maintenance in progress" page.

### Commands

Run them via `docker exec -it <container> <cmd>` or `kubectl exec -it <pod> -- <cmd>`.
All of them resolve the database path exactly the way `config/runtime.exs` does
(`DATABASE_PATH`, else `${CONFIG_PATH}/db/pinchflat.db`).

| Command                                     | What it does                                                                                                                                                                              |
| ------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `/app/bin/db_backup [--no-compress] [dest]` | Raw binary backup of the database file + `-wal` sidecar, zstd-compressed. Defaults to `${CONFIG_PATH}/db/backups/tubeless-<UTC timestamp>.tar.zst`. Refuses to overwrite an existing file |
| `/app/bin/db_check [file]`                  | `PRAGMA integrity_check` + `PRAGMA foreign_key_check`. Defaults to the live database; pass a path to verify a backup. Exits non-zero on any problem                                       |
| `/app/bin/db_shell [sql]`                   | Raw `sqlite3` REPL against the live database, or a one-shot query if you pass SQL. **This can write** — nothing validates what you run                                                    |

A backup is a single file: `VACUUM INTO` is used rather than `cp` so there are no
`-wal`/`-shm` sidecars to keep alongside it, it arrives already defragmented, and
it's written through SQLite so it's always a consistent snapshot.

The scripts also work against a _running_ container (SQLite allows concurrent
readers, and a `VACUUM INTO` backup is safe there), but they'll warn you first —
a backup taken mid-download is a snapshot of a moving target.

To restore, replace the database file while in maintenance mode and delete any
stale `-wal`/`-shm` sidecars next to it:

```bash
docker exec -it <container> sh -c 'cp /config/db/backups/tubeless-20260726-090000.db /config/db/pinchflat.db && rm -f /config/db/pinchflat.db-wal /config/db/pinchflat.db-shm'
```

Then run `/app/bin/db_check` to confirm it, remove `MAINTENANCE_MODE`, and restart.
Pending migrations run on that next normal boot.

### Related: online compaction

Routine `VACUUM`ing doesn't need any of this — Tools → Diagnostics has a "Compact
Now" button and an opt-in monthly cron (`DatabaseMaintenanceWorker`), which reserve
a quiet window by pausing the job queues instead of stopping the app. Maintenance
mode is for the cases where the file has to be touched from outside the app.

## Utility: List Published Docker Hub Images

Requires `curl` and `jq`. The repository must be public.

```bash
bash tooling/list-images.sh                         # wesdobry/tubeless
bash tooling/list-images.sh my-user my-image-name  # custom namespace/image
```

## Indexing System

Tubeless uses two complementary indexing strategies to detect new media. Together they balance detection latency against API/bandwidth cost.

### Fast Indexing

**Worker:** `lib/pinchflat/fast_indexing/fast_indexing_worker.ex`
**Queue:** `fast_indexing` (concurrency: `YT_DLP_WORKER_CONCURRENCY`, default 2)

Runs every 10 minutes per source (when `fast_index: true`). Cheap — only checks recent items, no full yt-dlp crawl.

**Execution flow:**

1. Fetches up to 50 recent media IDs for the source:
   - Prefers YouTube Data API v3 (`playlistItems` endpoint) if a `youtube_api_key` is configured. Multiple keys are supported and round-robined via an Agent.
   - Falls back to parsing `<yt:videoId>` tags from the YouTube RSS feed.
2. Queries the database for existing `MediaItem` records matching those IDs.
3. For each **new** media ID: constructs the watch URL, runs yt-dlp with `--simulate --skip-download` to fetch metadata, then upserts a `MediaItem` via `Media.create_media_item_from_backend_attrs/2` (conflict target: `[:source_id, :media_id]`).
4. Immediately kicks off a download job for each newly created pending item.
5. Calls `DownloadingHelpers.enqueue_pending_download_tasks/1` as a cleanup pass to catch any stragglers.
6. Sends an Apprise notification if new downloadable items were found (and `download_media: true`).
7. Reschedules itself 10 minutes out.

Fast indexing is started by the slow indexing worker after slow indexing completes, and only runs while `source.fast_index` is true.

### Slow Indexing

**Worker:** `lib/pinchflat/slow_indexing/media_collection_indexing_worker.ex`
**Queue:** `media_collection_indexing` (concurrency: `YT_DLP_WORKER_CONCURRENCY`, default 2)

A full yt-dlp metadata fetch of the entire source. Expensive but thorough. Runs on a schedule (`index_frequency_minutes`, default 1440 = 24 h). When fast indexing is enabled for a source, slow indexing is backed off to every 30 days — fast indexing covers the gap.

**Execution flow:**

1. **File follower setup** — starts `FileFollowerServer`, a GenServer that polls the yt-dlp output file every second. As yt-dlp writes JSON lines, the follower immediately parses each one, upserts a `MediaItem`, and kicks off a download job. This means downloads can begin before the full index completes.

2. **Download archive** (channels only, scheduled re-indexing) — queries the most recent 50 media items for the source, skips the 20 newest, and writes the next 30 as a yt-dlp archive file (`youtube {media_id}` one per line). This is passed with `--break-on-existing` so yt-dlp stops when it reaches known media and doesn't re-crawl the full history.

3. **Per-tab crawl** (YouTube channels only) — channels are indexed as three separate yt-dlp invocations against `/videos`, `/shorts`, and `/streams` tab URLs. This is required because `--break-on-existing` aborts the entire yt-dlp process when it hits a known item, not just the current content type — a single bare-channel-URL run would stop at the first known video and never reach shorts or streams tabs. Each tab gets its own archive filtered to its content type. Playlists and non-YouTube sources are indexed as a single URL. A tab that errors (e.g. channel has no Shorts) is skipped; the run fails only if all tabs fail.

4. **Deduplication** — after all tabs complete, results are deduped by `media_id` before the final upsert pass.

5. **Cleanup** — updates `source.last_indexed_at`, then calls `DownloadingHelpers.enqueue_pending_download_tasks/1` to enqueue anything the file follower may have missed.

6. **Fast indexing handoff** — deletes any pending fast-indexing jobs for the source and re-enqueues them fresh (so their 10-minute clock starts from now, not from before the slow index ran).

### How They Complement Each Other

|                     | Fast                              | Slow                                   |
| ------------------- | --------------------------------- | -------------------------------------- |
| Frequency           | Every 10 min                      | Every 24 h (or 30 d with fast enabled) |
| Scope               | Last ~50 items via RSS/API        | Full channel/playlist history          |
| yt-dlp calls        | One per new video (metadata only) | One per content tab (full crawl)       |
| Real-time downloads | Yes (per new ID)                  | Yes (via file follower)                |
| Download archive    | No                                | Yes (channels, scheduled re-index)     |

On first source creation, slow indexing runs immediately to build the full media catalog. Once that completes, fast indexing takes over for low-latency detection of new uploads. Both paths use the same `create_media_item_from_backend_attrs/2` upsert so concurrent runs are idempotent.

### How yt-dlp Is Invoked During Indexing

All yt-dlp calls funnel through `YtDlp.CommandRunner.run/5` (`lib/pinchflat/yt_dlp/command_runner.ex`), which implements the `YtDlpCommandRunner` behaviour (mockable in tests via the `yt_dlp_runner` config). The runner builds the argument list, shells out, and reads results back from a file.

**Execution wrapper.** yt-dlp is never called directly — it's launched through `priv/cmd_wrapper.sh`, which runs the command in the background and kills it (`kill -KILL`) the moment its stdin closes. This is what lets Oban terminate the external yt-dlp process when a job is cancelled or the worker dies, rather than leaving an orphaned 30-minute crawl running.

**Output capture.** Commands do **not** parse stdout (yt-dlp writes warnings/progress there and pollutes JSON). Instead every call appends `--print-to-file "<template>" <filepath>`, writing one JSON object per line to a tmpfile. `ResponseDecoder` (`response_decoder.ex`) reads the file back and decodes each line independently, returning a clean `{:error, binary()}` on malformed/truncated output instead of raising.

**Option building.** A keyword list of options is converted to CLI args by `CliUtils.parse_options/1` (`lib/pinchflat/utils/cli_utils.ex`): atom keys become kebab-cased flags (`:skip_download` → `--skip-download`, `ignore_no_formats_error` → `--ignore-no-formats-error`), and key/value pairs become `--flag value` (`sleep_interval: 2.5` → `--sleep-interval 2.5`). `CommandRunner` concatenates option groups in a fixed order: caller opts → print-to-file → cookies → rate-limit → misc → globals. Globals always applied: `--windows-filenames --quiet --cache-dir <tmp>/yt-dlp-cache`.

**Download quality selection.** `Downloading.QualityOptionBuilder` converts a MediaProfile's resolution, codec, container, and audio-track preferences into yt-dlp `--format` and `--format-sort` options. If `ignore_youtube_super_resolution` is enabled, it adds `[format_note!*=?AI-upscaled]` to every selected stream and fallback branch. The unknown-inclusive `?` keeps formats that do not expose `format_note`; filtering the final `best` fallback prevents it from re-selecting an AI-upscaled video. The option is off by default and affects downloads and predicted output paths, not collection indexing.

**Cross-cutting options** (added by `CommandRunner`, not the callers):

- **Cookies** — `--cookies <extras>/cookies.txt` is added only when the caller passes `use_cookies: true` _and_ a non-empty cookies file exists. Callers decide via `Sources.use_cookies?(source, :metadata | :indexing)`.
- **Rate limiting** — `--limit-rate` from the `throughput_limit` setting, plus jittered `--sleep-requests`/`--sleep-interval`/`--sleep-subtitles` (unless the caller passes `skip_sleep_interval: true`). Jitter is applied per-run via `NumberUtils.add_jitter`.
- **Misc** — `--restrict-filenames` when that setting is enabled.

**Slow indexing command** — built in `SlowIndexingHelpers` and run via `MediaCollection.get_media_attributes_for_collection/3`. Base flags:

```
--simulate --skip-download --ignore-no-formats-error --no-warnings
```

`--ignore-no-formats-error` keeps premiere/upcoming videos from aborting the crawl; `--no-warnings` keeps the JSON output clean. For scheduled channel re-indexing it also adds `--break-on-existing --download-archive <tmpfile>`, where the archive is a `youtube <media_id>` list of recent-but-not-newest items (skip the 20 newest, take the next 30) so yt-dlp halts once it reaches known media. If the source has an `index_cutoff_date`, each YouTube channel tab additionally gets `--break-match-filters "upload_date >= YYYYMMDD"` plus `--break-match-filters "!upload_date"` (repeated filters are OR'd — break only when a video _has_ an upload date and it's older than the cutoff), aborting the crawl at the cutoff even on first/forced indexes; playlists and non-YouTube sources never get this since their listing order isn't newest-first. The indexing output template captures the fields needed to build a `MediaItem`:

```
%(.{id,title,live_status,original_url,description,aspect_ratio,duration,upload_date,timestamp,playlist_index,filename})j
```

The output filepath is passed explicitly (not auto-generated) so the `FileFollowerServer` can tail the same file line-by-line as yt-dlp appends to it. Exit codes are interpreted loosely for indexing: `0` is success, and `101` (break-on-existing / max-downloads hit) and `1` (a missing tab on a channel) are treated as expected rather than failures.

**Fast indexing command** — RSS/API supplies the recent media IDs (no yt-dlp), then each _new_ ID is resolved individually via `YtDlp.Media.get_media_attributes/3` with:

```
--simulate --skip-download
```

reusing the same indexing output template. There's no file follower here — it's a blocking call per video that returns the full JSON.

### Per-Source Indexing Settings

Applies to first/forced indexes too. Widening it further into the past (an earlier date, or clearing it) on an enabled source auto-kicks a **forced** re-index on save so the newly in-range older videos get crawled; narrowing it does nothing since those items are already indexed |

### Global Indexing Settings

| Setting                            | Description                                                                                                                       |
| ---------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `youtube_api_key`                  | Comma-separated YouTube Data API v3 keys; fast indexing uses these in round-robin. Without this, fast indexing falls back to RSS. |
| `extractor_sleep_interval_seconds` | Delay between yt-dlp requests (rate limiting, default 0)                                                                          |
| `ignore_unavailable_media`         | Mark members-only/private/removed videos as permanently unavailable instead of retrying                                           |

## Proxy Support

Tubeless can route yt-dlp network traffic through a proxy. Configured under
**Settings → Proxy** with three modes:

- **No proxy** — direct connections (default).
- **Manual proxy URL** — one fixed proxy passed to yt-dlp as `--proxy`. Supports
  `http`, `https`, `socks4`, and `socks5` schemes (e.g. `http://user:pass@host:8080`).
  The **Test** button confirms reachability via a lightweight IP-echo request and reports
  the exit IP.
- **Proxy list file (`proxy.json`)** — a list of proxies; **one is picked at random for
  each yt-dlp request**. Managed exactly like the cookies file (upload / download / clear /
  test) in the separate **Proxy File** box, and stored at `<extras>/proxy.json`.

`proxy.json` format (only `host`, `port`, `protocol`, `username`, `password` are used;
the rest is informational). An entry needs at least a host and port:

```json
[
  {
    "time": 1.23,
    "city": "Unknown city",
    "country": "Germany",
    "host": "203.0.113.10",
    "protocol": "http",
    "port": 8080,
    "username": "",
    "password": ""
  }
]
```

### What is proxied

- **Always (when a proxy is set):** every yt-dlp call — source discovery, metadata,
  slow/fast indexing, availability checks, thumbnails, downloads — plus the yt-dlp
  **self-update** (it reaches GitHub). The local `yt-dlp --version` check stays direct.
- **Opt-in (`Also use proxy for RSS & YouTube API requests` toggle):** Tubeless's own RSS-feed and
  YouTube Data API HTTP calls. These use Erlang `:httpc`, which **can only reach a proxy over
  plain TCP** — so only plain `http` proxies can cover them. An `https` (TLS-to-proxy) or SOCKS
  proxy falls back to a direct connection for these requests (yt-dlp still honours it, and the
  Test button can't auto-verify those either). Leave the toggle off to keep your API-key traffic
  off third-party proxies.

Settings changes take effect on the next request — no restart. A failed proxy surfaces as
a normal yt-dlp error and the next Oban retry (in `file` mode) picks a fresh random proxy.
There is no health-checking or automatic rotation-on-failure.

| Setting             | Default | Description                                                 |
| ------------------- | ------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- |
| `proxy_mode`        | `none`  | `none` \| `manual` \| `file`                                |
| `proxy_url`         | —       | The manual proxy URL (used only in `manual` mode)           |
| `proxy_covers_http` | `false` | Also route RSS + YouTube Data API traffic through the proxy |

## Podcast Support

Two delivery modes, sharing the same feed builders (`lib/pinchflat/podcasts/`):

### Dynamic feeds (served by Tubeless)

The original mode. `GET /sources/opml` (all sources, `route_token`-protected), `GET /sources/:uuid/feed`
(per-source RSS), and image/`/media/:uuid/stream` endpoints render everything per-request. These routes
deliberately bypass basic auth so podcast apps work — fine on a trusted LAN, not something to expose
to the internet.

### Static podcasts (serve-in-place)

For setups where Tubeless is never reachable by the podcast client. Podcast sources download
**straight into** the servable podcast library — nothing is copied — and any static web server
(nginx etc.) hosts it independently:

```
<PODCAST_PATH>/                 # the podcast library; default: <media dir>/podcasts
  opml.xml                      # all published sources
  lex-fridman/                  # the source's stable slug
    feed.xml                    # generated
    cover.jpg                   # generated (small copy of the source cover)
    2026-07-19 dQw4w9WgXcQ.mp3  # the download itself — never duplicated
    2026-07-19 dQw4w9WgXcQ.jpg  # episode thumbnail (when downloaded)
```

Episode filenames are deliberately minimal — date for browsability, video ID for uniqueness.
Titles live in the feed, and simple names make simple, robust enclosure URLs.

- **Enablement**: the `MediaProfile.podcast_enabled` toggle. Every source using a publishing
  profile is served in place; there is no per-source toggle. Audio vs video follows the profile's
  `Preferred Resolution` — `Audio Only` makes an audio podcast, anything else keeps the video.
- **`Podcast URL Base` setting** (required): the public origin the static server serves the library
  at (e.g. `http://pods.local`). All feed links are built from it; until it's set, exports cancel
  (visible in the job diagnostics) and the source page shows a warning banner.
- **Naming**: each source gets a stable, unique, readable `slug` (from its name, suffixed on
  collision) that names its folder and feed URL. Slugs are kept across renames so subscriptions
  don't break. Enclosure/thumbnail URLs are each file's real library-relative path, URL-encoded.
  Sources created before slugs existed are backfilled by the `BackfillSourceSlugs` migration — a
  nil slug otherwise crashes the output-path template parser for **every** source's download, not
  just podcast ones.
- **Layout wins over overrides**: for a podcast source the slug-rooted template is used even when the
  source has an `output_path_template_override`, because the static server and generated feed URLs
  depend on that layout.
- **Only in-library media is served**: media that isn't under `PODCAST_PATH` (e.g. episodes
  downloaded before the source became a podcast) is excluded from the static feed until re-downloaded
  into the library — its enclosure URL wouldn't resolve on the static server otherwise.
- **No duplication**: `PodcastExport` only ever writes `feed.xml`, `cover`, and `opml.xml`. Media is
  owned by the download/retention system; it lives here because it downloaded here (via a
  slug-rooted output template and `podcast_directory` base). Turning `PODCAST_PATH` into a separate
  volume just means downloads land there directly — still no copies.
- **Profile form UX**: while `Publish as Podcast` is on, the media profile form swaps the output
  path template for a read-only preview of the effective download path
  (`<PODCAST_PATH>/{{ source_slug }}/…`), relabels `Preferred Resolution` to `Podcast Format`, and
  links to the Podcast RSS Feeds wiki page.
- **Freshness**: `PodcastExportWorker` runs debounced (~30 s) after downloads, deletions,
  retention/culling, and relevant source/profile/settings edits; `PodcastSweepWorker` reconciles
  everything daily at 04:00 as a safety net (regenerating feeds and pruning generated feeds whose
  slug is no longer published — never touching media or unrelated folders).

Minimal nginx example for hosting the library:

```nginx
server {
  listen 80;
  server_name pods.local;
  root /downloads/podcasts;

  autoindex off;
  add_header X-Content-Type-Options nosniff;
  location / {
    try_files $uri =404;
  }
}
```

## Reconcile

Tools → Reconcile (`/reconciliation`) trues up already-downloaded files after
path-affecting settings changes — output path templates, the podcast toggle, restricted
filenames, sidecar toggles — **without re-downloading media**.

Flow: always **Scan and Build Plan first** (a background job builds a persisted, paginated report
of planned moves/backfills/deletions), then an explicit **Apply This Plan** confirmation. Applying
pauses all job queues, waits for executing jobs to finish (like database compaction does), moves
files + updates the DB, then resumes the queues. Saving a Source, Media Profile, or global Setting
marks any staged (ready) plan **stale**, since those edits can change predicted paths — build a
fresh plan after changing settings.

Three modes:

- **Local only** — zero network. New paths are rendered by feeding each item's stored metadata
  blob back to yt-dlp (`--load-info-json`), so yt-dlp applies filename sanitization exactly as a
  real download would. Moves/renames everything and rebuilds NFO/info.json sidecars from stored
  metadata.
- **Online mode** — additionally backfills sidecars that were never downloaded (missing
  thumbnails/subtitles) with one light yt-dlp fetch per affected video.
- **Full sync** — everything Online mode does (the full set of move/backfill/delete rows), _plus_
  schedules a full media re-download for items whose on-disk format no longer matches the profile
  (an audio-only↔video switch, or a container change). A format-mismatched item gets both: its
  normal move relocates the existing file offline, and the later re-download replaces it with the
  correct format at that same path (cleaning up the stale file itself). Detection is purely from the
  file extension — no JSON parsing — because that reflects the real post-remux file and the
  clearly-decidable cases; resolution/embed/sponsorblock state can't be judged reliably offline, so
  those never trigger a re-download. A video profile with no explicit container implies `.mp4`, so
  files in other containers are flagged. Re-downloads run after the reconcile window closes (reusing
  the "Redownload Existing" path) and do use bandwidth.

No mode ever uses the YouTube Data API. Sidecar files whose profile toggle is now off are
**deleted** on apply (the report lists them and the confirmation warns). Collisions (two files
resolving to the same target, or an occupied target path) are reported and skipped; apply and
re-run to resolve move chains. Caveat: offline rendering uses metadata as of download time, so a
video whose title changed on YouTube renders under its old title — consistent with what's on disk.

## Database Integrity Checks

The **Check Integrity** button in the Database section of the diagnostics page runs a SQLite
integrity check and reports whatever it finds. Two modes:

- **Quick check** (`PRAGMA quick_check`) — verifies the structure of every page, plus the
  contents of the FTS5 search index. Seconds to a minute on a typical database.
- **Full check** (`PRAGMA integrity_check`) — everything the quick check does, and additionally
  cross-checks every index entry against its table. Thorough, and considerably slower.

Both are **read-only** and take only a read transaction, so in WAL mode they never block writers.
Downloads and indexing keep running while a check is in progress — unlike compaction, no quiet
window is reserved. The only cost is the I/O of reading the whole database file, which is why the
check runs in a LiveView behind a spinner rather than a blocking request.

Since SQLite 3.44 an integrity check also calls each virtual table's `xIntegrity` method, so
damage to the FTS5 search index shows up here too, e.g.:

```
malformed inverted index for FTS5 table main.media_items_search_index
```

### Repairs are manual and deliberate

The check never repairs anything, and there is no repair button. Full procedures live in the
[Database Repair](https://github.com/CommunityMaintained/tubeless/wiki/Database-Repair) wiki page,
which the findings panel links to. What to do depends entirely on what's damaged, and the safest
place to do it is with Tubeless stopped:

- **Search index only** (findings naming `media_items_search_index`) — the index is derived
  entirely from `media_items`, so rebuilding it is lossless:

  ```bash
  sqlite3 pinchflat.db "INSERT INTO media_items_search_index(media_items_search_index) VALUES('rebuild');"
  ```

- **Anything else** — corruption in a real table has no in-place repair. Stop the container and
  restore from a backup. Continuing to write to a damaged database spreads the damage into
  subsequent backups.

Back up the database file before attempting any repair.

**Restart Tubeless after any repair.** Repairing from a second connection while the app is
running does not clear the finding for the app itself — its existing pool connections keep
reporting the old corruption (SQLite caches FTS5 index state per connection). Verified locally:
after an out-of-band `rebuild`, a fresh `sqlite3` connection reported `ok` while the running app
still reported `fts5: checksum mismatch`, and only a restart brought the in-app check back to
green. This is the main practical reason to repair with the app stopped rather than underneath it.
